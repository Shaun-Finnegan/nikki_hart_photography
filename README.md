## Color Scheme
The colour scheme I have choosen for this website is a simple as it gets. I wanted to keep the colour scheme simple so to keep the focus of the site on Nikki's work. I therefore choose two colors for the site. (Black and White) as I didn't want the users to have any distractions and by keeping the color scheme super simple it allows Nikki's work to be the sole focus of the website.


## Structure
The structure of the website is very straight forward. The purpose of this was to encourage the user to spend time on the products page looking through Nikki's portfolio of work and in doing so encouraging the user to make a purchase.

## Feature

### Logo Account and Basket
The first feature is what the user is greated with when the enter the site, this is the logo and the account and basket. This was done so that as soon as the user enters the site they instantly know what the site is about and that they can create an account and make purchases.

![Logo Account and Basket](https://github.com/Shaun-Finnegan/nikki_hart_photography/blob/main/readme-ms4-images/feature-title-account-basket.png)


### Main Navigation
As mentioned earlier this was kept as simple as possible to entice the user to spend the majority of their visit on the products page and thus lead to more purchases.

### Banner Image
This is placed on the home page so that the user can instantly see an example of Nikki's work and this will hopefully get the users interest and encouagethem to explore the site further.

### Products Page

This is the page that we want the user to spend most of their time on. It allows them to look at Nikki's Portfolio of work and hopefully click on one of the links to procede with making a purchase.

### The Shopping Bag
Once the user has added a product to their bag they will be able to see a summary of this in their basket.
The shopping bag gives the user full C.R.U.D functionality as they will be able to see what they have added. They will also be able to adjust the quantity or remove the item from the basket completley.

### Secure Checkout
This feature will allow the user to check out their items in their bag.
The user must register or login to be able to make a payment and then their payment details will be saved so that when the user logs into the site in the future making a purchase will be easier as their information will have been saved.

### Additional Tools Used

* Elephant SQL

* W3C CSS Validator
* CI Python Linter
* JustInMind Prototyping Tool


## Testing

### Cross Platform Testing

Once the site was completed and deployed it was tested on four web browsers to check that the application behaved and performed the same way on each one. The browsers used where

* Google Chrome
* Mozilla FireFox
* Microsoft Edge
* Safari

Overall I was pleased to see that the sites performancer and behaviour was consistent througfhout all four browsers.


## Compatability Testing
Once deployed the site was tested on numerous devices to ensure that performance and behaviour were consistent. The devices used are as follows:

* Asus VivoBook Laptop
* Ipad Air 3
* Samsung Galaxy s8
* Oppo a72
* Various templates with Chrome Dev Tools

## Responsive Testing
As well as the application been tested on all the devices mentioned above, the application was also tested using the responsive screen view in chrome dev tools. This additional testing really helped to pick out any responsiveness issues that had previously been overlooked. However the application was very responsive and behaved the way the developer intended on all screen sizes.

### Performance and Accessibility Testing
To test the performance and accessibility of the application I used Google Chrome Lighthouse. I must say that overall I am happy with the results on desktop but not on mobile devices.
